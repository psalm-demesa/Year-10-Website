    <h1 class="indiepop"> What is Indie Pop?</h1>
    <p class="indiepop">Indie pop is a music genre and subculture that combines guitar pop with DIY ethic 
        in opposition to the style and <br> tone of mainstream pop music. It originated from British post-punk 
        in the late 1970s and subsequently generated <br> a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit.</p>
